  <b>Proposed Level of Achievement:</b> Artemis

  <b>Motivation: </b>
  <p>
    As a NUS Computing freshman, you must have heard of the summer project,
    kindly organised by NUS School of Computing, Orbital. It is early March, and
    you have received an email from the module coordinator. You read the email
    and notice a word that students dread, ‚Äòdeadline‚Äô. You think to yourself,
    "What?! I have only this long to find myself a partner and register for it."
    Based on our personal recollections: we are freshmen who are interested in
    doing the Orbital Project. This project requires us to work in pairs. We
    went on a hunt on several social media platforms to look for a partner and
    we have had troubles along the way. When we found someone, we asked for
    their contact and proceeded to find out whether he or she is the right fit.
    Don't you find the process of looking for a partner rather cumbersome? It is
    indeed quite a hassle. Is there a way to provide a better experience for
    future registrants?
  </p>
  <b>Aim:</b>
  <p>
    We hope to provide a centralised platform to improve the process of finding
    a partner for Orbital. Here, students will be able to find the most suitable
    partner based on their preferences, if not, the system will offer
    recommendations.
  </p>

  <b>Competitor Analysis: </b>
  Competitor's Name | User's Experience with Competitors App | User's Experience with OrbiTinder
  --- | --- | ---
  **Reddit**| The NUS subreddit only comprises a small percentage of NUS students interested in Orbital. | OrbiTinder would primarily be adopted by students interested in forming teams for Orbital
  **Reddit**| Reddit post‚Äôs audience reach depends on the popularity of the post and it‚Äôs age. Older posts and posts with low numbers of upvotes tend not to have high levels of engagement. | User profiles on OrbiTinder will receive engagement based on whether they meet the preferences of other users
  **Reddit**| Users may choose not to include their technical backgrounds in their posts, which can deter others from reaching out to them. | OrbiTinder would require users to include details such as technical backgrounds etc, making it much more likely for interested users to reach out to them.
  **Telegram** |Students currently post messages in large NUS module group chats as a way to potentially find those that are interested in teaming up with them. <br/> Such group chats comprise a small percentage of NUS students interested in Orbital.| OrbiTinder would primarily be adopted by students interested in forming teams for Orbital.
