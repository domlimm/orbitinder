  <b>Proposed Level of Achievement: Artemis</b>

  <b>Motivation: </b>
  <p>
    As a NUS Computing freshman, you must have heard of the summer project,
    kindly organised by NUS School of Computing, Orbital. It is early March, and
    you have received an email from the module coordinator. You read the email
    and notice a word that students dread, ‘deadline’. You think to yourself,
    "What?! I have only this long to find myself a partner and register for it."
    Based on our personal recollections: we are freshmen who are interested in
    doing the Orbital Project. This project requires us to work in pairs. We
    went on a hunt on several social media platforms to look for a partner and
    we have had troubles along the way. When we found someone, we asked for
    their contact and proceeded to find out whether he or she is the right fit.
    Don't you find the process of looking for a partner rather cumbersome? It is
    indeed quite a hassle. Is there a way to provide a better experience for
    future registrants?
  </p>
  <b>Aim:</b>
  <p>
    We hope to provide a centralised platform to improve the process of finding
    a partner for Orbital. Here, students will be able to find the most suitable
    partner based on their preferences, if not, the system will offer
    recommendations.
